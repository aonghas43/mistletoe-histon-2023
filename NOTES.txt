1) Survey data 

1.1) Storage
stored in spreadsheet and cleaned, correlated with previous survey data :
- new data
- changes
- picture link
- all data points to have E/N (Nat grid) and lat-long coords
- first surveyed, last surveyed date
- OS grid reference optional by-product of using OS online coordinate converter, crude check that convreted points are in right place

1.2) Cluster sizes above 9 normalized to 10 or 20 for counting purposes

2) Coordinates : multiple formats stored

OSGB E/N
Lat-long
What3words

Derived in one of several ways :

a) from street address, using publicly available data from Ordnance survey (OS data Open UPRN [unique property reference numbers]) https://osdatahub.os.uk/downloads/open/OpenUPRN

b) What3words location, where provided, using what3words coordinate converter. https://what3words.com/products/batch-converter.CAn concert between w3w and lat-long.
What3words location can be backfilled from other coordinates where present.

c) Previous survey OS National grid E/N coordinates, converted using OS batch converter: https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/gps/transformation/batch. Can transform either way between E/N and lat/long.

d) OS converter used to derive E/N from lat-long

3.1) Storage
Stored in google drive, picture field is shareable link.
